Description: 
The STM32G061x6/x8 mainstream microcontrollers are based on high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M0+ 32-bit RISC core operating at up to 64 MHz frequency. Offering a high level of integration, they are suitable for a wide range of applications in consumer, industrial and appliance domains and ready for the Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.The devices incorporate a memory protection unit (MPU), high-speed embedded memories (18 Kbytes of SRAM and up to 64 Kbytes of Flash program memory with read protection, write protection, proprietary code protection, and securable area), DMA, an extensive range of system functions, enhanced I/Os, and peripherals. The devices offer standard communication interfaces (two I2Cs, two SPIs / one I2S, and two USARTs), one 12-bit ADC (2.5 MSps) with up to 19 channels, one 12-bit DAC with two channels, two fast comparators, an internal voltage reference buffer, a low-power RTC, an advanced control PWM timer running at up to double the CPU frequency, five general-purpose 16-bit timers with one running at up to double the CPU frequency, a 32-bit general-purpose timer, two low-power 16-bit timers, two watchdog timers, and a SysTick timer.The devices embed AES hardware accelerator and true random number generator (RNG).The devices operate within ambient temperatures from -40 to 125°C and with supply voltages from 1.7 V to 3.6 V. Optimized dynamic consumption combined with a comprehensive set of power-saving modes, low-power timers and low-power UART, allows the design of low-power applications.VBAT direct battery input allows keeping RTC and backup registers powered.The devices come in packages with 20 to 48 pins.
