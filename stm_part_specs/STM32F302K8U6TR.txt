Description: 
The STM32F302x6/8 family is based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 72 MHz and embedding a floating point unit (FPU). The family incorporates high-speed embedded memories (up to 64 Kbytes of Flash memory, 16 Kbytes of SRAM), and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses.The devices offer a fast 12-bit ADC (5 Msps), three comparators, an operational amplifier, up to 18 capacitive sensing channels, one DAC channel, a low-power RTC, one general-purpose 32-bit timer, one timer dedicated to motor control, and up to three general-purpose 16-bit timers, and one timer to drive the DAC. They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces: three I2Cs, up to three USARTs, up to two SPIs with multiplexed full-duplex I2S, a USB FS device, a CAN, and an infrared transmitter.The STM32F302x6/8 family operates in the –40 to +85°C and –40 to +105°C temperature ranges from at a 2.0 to 3.6 V power supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving mode allows the design of low-power applications.The STM32F302x6/8 family offers devices in 32-, 48-, 49- and 64-pin packages.The set of included peripherals changes with the device chosen.
