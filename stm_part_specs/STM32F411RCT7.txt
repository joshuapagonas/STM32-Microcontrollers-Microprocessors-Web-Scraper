Description: 
The STM32F411xC/xE devices are based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex® -M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 100 MHz. The Cortex®-M4 core features a floating-point unit (FPU) single precision, which supports all Arm single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU), which enhances application security.The STM32F411xC/xE belongs to the STM32 Dynamic Efficiency product line (with products combining power efficiency, performance and integration) while adding a new innovative feature called Batch Acquisition Mode (BAM) allowing to save even more power consumption during data batching.The STM32F411xC/xE incorporate high-speed embedded memories (up to 512 Kbytes of flash memory, 128 Kbytes of SRAM), and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, two AHB bus and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.All devices offer one 12-bit ADC, a low-power RTC, six general-purpose 16-bit timers including one PWM timer for motor control, two general-purpose 32-bit timers. They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces.
