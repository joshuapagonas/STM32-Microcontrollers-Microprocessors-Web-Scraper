Description: 
The STM32WB0xxC is an ultra-low-power programmable Bluetooth® Low Energy wireless SoC solution. It embeds STMicroelectronics state-of-art 2.4 GHz RF radio IPs combining unparalleled performance with extremely long-battery lifetime. It is compliant with Bluetooth® Low Energy SIG core specification version 5.4 addressing point-to-point connectivity and Bluetooth Mesh networking and allows large-scale device networks to be established in a reliable way. The STM32WB0xxC is also suitable for 2.4 GHz proprietary radio wireless communication to address ultra-low latency applications.The STM32WB0xxC embeds a Cortex®‑M0+ microcontroller that can operate up to 64 MHz and also the BlueNRG core coprocessor (DMA based) for Bluetooth® Low Energy timing critical operations.In addition, the STM32WB0xxC provides enhanced security hardware support by dedicated hardware functions:True random number generator (RNG), encryption AES maximum 128-bit security coprocessor, public key accelerator (PKA), CRC calculation unit, 64-bit unique ID, flash memory read and write protection.The STM32WB0xxC can be configured to support standalone or network processor applications. In the first configuration, the STM32WB0xxC operates as a single device in the application for managing both the application code and the Bluetooth® Low Energy stack.The STM32WB0xxC embeds high-speed and flexible memory types: flash memory of 256 Kbytes, RAM memory of 64 Kbytes, one-time-programmable (OTP) memory area of 1 Kbyte, ROM memory of 7 Kbytes (ST reserved area).Direct data transfer between memory and peripherals and from memory-to-memory is supported by eight DMA channels with a full flexible channel mapping by the DMAMUX peripheral.The STM32WB0xxC embeds a 12-bit ADC, allowing measurements of up to eight external sources and up to three internal sources, including battery monitoring and a temperature sensor.The STM32WB0xxC has a low-power RTC and one advanced 16-bit timer.The STM32WB0xxC features standard and advanced communication interfaces:1x SPI, 2x SPI/I2S, 1x LPUART, 1x USART supporting ISO 7816 (smartcard mode), IrDA, and modbus mode, 2x I2C supporting SMBus/PMBus, 1x channel PDM.The STM32WB0xxC operates in the -40 to +105°C temperature range from a 1.7 V to 3.6 V power supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving modes enables the design of low-power applications.The STM32WB0xxC integrates a high efficiency SMPS step-down converter and an integrated PDR circuitry with a fixed threshold that generates a device reset when the VDD drops under 1.65 V.The STM32WB0xxC comes in different package versions supporting up to:32 I/Os for the VFQFPN48 package, 20 I/Os for the VFQFPN32 package, 30 I/Os for the WLCSP49 package.
