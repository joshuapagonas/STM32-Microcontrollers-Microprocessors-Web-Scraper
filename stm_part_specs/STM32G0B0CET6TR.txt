Description: 
The STM32G0B0KE/CE/RE/VE mainstream microcontrollers are based on high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M0+ 32-bit RISC core operating at up to 64 MHz frequency. Offering a high level of integration, they are suitable for a wide range of applications in consumer, industrial and appliance domains and ready for the Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.The devices incorporate a memory protection unit (MPU), high-speed embedded memories (144 Kbytes of SRAM and 512 Kbytes of Flash program memory with read protection, write protection), DMA, an extensive range of system functions, enhanced I/Os, and peripherals. The devices offer standard communication interfaces (three I2Cs, three SPIs / two I2S, one full-speed USB, and six USARTs), one 12-bit ADC (2.5 MSps) with up to 19 channels, a low-power RTC, an advanced control PWM timer, six general-purpose 16-bit timers, two basic timers, two watchdog timers, and a SysTick timer.The devices operate within ambient temperatures from -40 to 85°C and with supply voltages from 2.0 V to 3.6 V. Optimized dynamic consumption combined with a comprehensive set of power-saving modes allows the design of low-power applications.VBAT direct battery input allows keeping RTC and backup registers powered.The devices come in packages with 32 to 100 pins.
