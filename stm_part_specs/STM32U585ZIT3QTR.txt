Description: 
The STM32U585xx devices belong to an ultra-low-power microcontrollers family (STM32U5 series) based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M33 32-bit RISC core. They operate at a frequency of up to 160 MHz.The Cortex®-M33 core features a single-precision FPU (floating-point unit), that supports all the Arm® single-precision data-processing instructions and all the data types.The Cortex®-M33 core also implements a full set of DSP (digital signal processing) instructions and a MPU (memory protection unit) that enhances the application security.The devices embed high-speed memories (2 Mbytes of flash memory and 786 Kbytes of SRAM), an FSMC (flexible external memory controller) for static memories (for devices with packages of 90 pins and more), two Octo-SPI flash memory interfaces (at least one Quad-SPI available on all packages) and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to three APB buses, three AHB buses and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.The devices offer security foundation compliant with the TBSA (trusted-based security architecture) requirements from Arm®. It embeds the necessary security features to implement a secure boot, secure data storage and secure firmware update. Besides these capabilities, the devices incorporate a secure firmware installation feature that allows the customer to secure the provisioning of the code during its production. A flexible lifecycle is managed thanks to multiple levels of readout protection and debug unlock with password. Firmware hardware isolation is supported thanks to securable peripherals, memories and I/Os, and privilege configuration of peripherals and memories.The devices feature several protection mechanisms for embedded flash memory and SRAM: readout protection, write protection, secure, and hide protection areas.The devices embed several peripherals reinforcing security: a fast AES coprocessor, a secure AES coprocessor with DPA resistance and hardware unique key that can be shared by hardware with fast AES, a PKA (public key accelerator) with DPA resistance, an on-the-fly decryption engine for Octo-SPI external memories, a HASH hardware accelerator, and a true random number generator.The devices offer active tamper detection and protection against transient and environmental perturbation attacks, thanks to several internal monitoring generating secret data erase in case of attack. This helps to fit the PCI requirements for point of sales applications.The devices offer one fast 14-bit ADC (2.5 Msps), one 12-bit ADC (2.5 Msps), two comparators, two operational amplifiers, two DAC channels, an internal voltage reference buffer, a low-power RTC, four 32-bit general-purpose timers, two 16-bit PWM timers dedicated to motor control, three 16-bit general-purpose timers, two 16-bit basic timers and four 16-bit low-power timers.The devices support an MDF (multifunction digital filter) with six filters dedicated to the connection of external sigma-delta modulators. Another low-power digital filter dedicated to audio signals is embedded (ADF), with one filter supporting sound-activity detection. The devices embed also a Chrom-ART Accelerator dedicated to graphic applications, and mathematical accelerators (a trigonometric functions accelerator plus a filter mathematical accelerator). In addition, up to 22 capacitive sensing channels are available.The devices also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces such as: four I2Cs, three SPIs, three USARTs, two UARTs, one low-power UART, two SAIs, one digital camera interface (DCMI), two SDMMCs, one FDCAN, one USB OTG full-speed, one USB Type-C /USB Power Delivery controller, and one generic synchronous 8-/16-bit PSSI (parallel data input/output slave interface).The devices operate in the –40 to +85 °C (+105 °C junction) and –40 to +125 °C (+130 °C junction) temperature ranges from a 1.71 to 3.6 V power supply.A comprehensive set of power-saving modes allow the design of low-power applications. Many peripherals (including communication, analog, timers, and audio peripherals) can be functional and autonomous down to Stop mode with direct memory access, thanks to LPBAM support (low-power background autonomous mode).Some independent power supplies are supported like an analog independent supply input for ADC, DACs, OPAMPs and comparators, a 3.3 V dedicated supply input for USB and up to 14 I/Os that can be supplied independently down to 1.08 V. A VBAT input is available for connecting a backup battery in order to preserve the RTC functionality and to backup 3232-bit registers and 2-Kbyte SRAM.The devices offer eight packages from 48 to 169 pins.
