Description: 
The STM32F401xD/xE devices are based on the high-performance ARM®Cortex® -M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 84 MHz. Its Cortex®-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports all ARM single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security.The STM32F401xD/xE incorporate high-speed embedded memories (512 Kbytes of Flash memory, 96 Kbytes of SRAM), and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, two AHB buses and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.All devices offer one 12-bit ADC, a low-power RTC, six general-purpose 16-bit timers including one PWM timer for motor control, two general-purpose 32-bit timers. They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces.
