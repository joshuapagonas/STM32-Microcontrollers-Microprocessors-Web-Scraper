Description: 
The high-density STM8AL3xE8x ultra-low-power devices feature an enhanced STM8 CPU core providing increased processing power (up to 16 MIPS at 16 MHz) while maintaining the advantages of a CISC architecture with improved code density, a 24-bit linear addressing space and an optimized architecture for low-power operations.The family includes an integrated debug module with a hardware interface (SWIM) which allows non-intrusive in-application debugging and ultrafast Flash programming.All high-density STM8AL3xE8x microcontrollers feature embedded data EEPROM and low-power low-voltage single-supply program Flash memory.The devices incorporate an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals, a 12-bit ADC, two DACs, two comparators, a real-time clock, AES, 8x40 or 4x44-segment LCD, four 16-bit timers, one 8-bit timer, as well as standard communication interfaces such as two SPIs, an I2C interface, and three USARTs. One 8x40 or 4x44-segment LCD is available on the STM8AL3LE8x devices. The modular design of the peripheral set allows the same peripherals to be found in different ST microcontroller families including 32-bit families. This makes any transition to a different family very easy, and simplified even more by the use of a common set of development tools.
