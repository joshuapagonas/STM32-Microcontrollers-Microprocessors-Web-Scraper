Description: 
The STM32L451xx devices are ultra-low-power microcontrollers based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 80 MHz. The Cortex-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision that supports all Arm® single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security.The STM32L451xx devices embed high-speed memories (Flash memory up to 512 Kbyte, 160 Kbyte of SRAM), a Quad SPI Flash memories interface (available on all packages) and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, two AHB buses and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.The STM32L451xx devices embed several protection mechanisms for embedded Flash memory and SRAM: readout protection, write protection, proprietary code readout protection and Firewall.The devices offer a fast 12-bit ADC (5 Msps), two comparators, one operational amplifier, one DAC channel, an internal voltage reference buffer, a low-power RTC, one general-purpose 32-bit timer, one 16-bit PWM timer dedicated to motor control, four general-purpose 16-bit timers, and two 16-bit low-power timers.In addition, up to 21 capacitive sensing channels are available.They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces, namely four I2Cs, three SPIs, three USARTs, one UART and one Low-Power UART, one SAI, one SDMMC, one CAN.The STM32L451xx operates in the -40 to +85 °C (+105 °C junction) and -40 to +125 °C (+130 °C junction) temperature ranges from a 1.71 to 3.6 V power supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving modes makes possible the design of low-power applications.Some independent power supplies are supported: analog independent supply input for ADC, DAC, OPAMP and comparators. A VBAT input makes it possible to backup the RTC and backup registers.The STM32L451xx family offers six packages from 48 to 100-pin packages.
