Description: 
The STM32U083xC devices are ultra-low-power microcontrollers based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M0+ 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 56 MHz.The STM32U083xC devices embed high-speed memories (256-Kbyte flash memory and 40-Kbyte SRAM with hardware parity check), and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to APB and AHB buses, and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.They also embed protection mechanisms for embedded flash memory and SRAM, such as readout protection and write protection.The STM32U083xC devices offer a 12-bit ADC, a 12-bit DAC, two embedded rail-to-rail analog comparators, one operational amplifier, a low-power RTC, one general-purpose 32-bit timer, one 16-bit PWM timer dedicated to motor control, three general-purpose 16-bit timers, and three 16-bit low-power timersThe devices also embed up to 21 capacitive sensing channels, plus an integrated LCD controller that enables to drive 8x48 or 4x52 segments with internal step-up converter.They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces, namely four I2Cs, three SPIs, four USARTs and three low-power UARTs, plus one crystal-less USB full-speed device.In addition, the STM32U083xC devices embed an AES hardware accelerator.The STM32U083xC operate in the -40 to +85 °C (+105 °C junction) and -40 to +125 °C (+130 °C junction) temperature ranges from a 1.71 to 3.6 V VDD power supply using an internal LDO regulator. A comprehensive set of power-saving modes makes possible the design of low-power applications.Independent power supplies are supported: analog independent supply input for ADC, DAC, OPAMP and comparator, as well as VBAT input allowing the backup of the RTC and backup registers.The STM32U083xC offer eight packages from 32 to 81 pins.
