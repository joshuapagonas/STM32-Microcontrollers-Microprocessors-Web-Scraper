Description: 
The STM8S903K3/F3 access line 8-bit microcontrollers offer 8 Kbyte Flash program memory, plus integrated true data EEPROM. The STM8S microcontroller family reference manual (RM0016) refers to devices in this family as low-density. They provide the following benefits: performance, robustness, and reduced system cost.Device performance and robustness are ensured by advanced core and peripherals made in a state-of-the art technology, a 16 MHz clock frequency, robust I/Os, independent watchdogs with separate clock source, and a clock security system.The system cost is reduced thanks to an integrated true data EEPROM for up to 300 k write/erase cycles and a high system integration level with internal clock oscillators, watchdog and brown-out reset.Full documentation is offered as well as a wide choice of development tools.
