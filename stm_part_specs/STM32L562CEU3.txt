Description: 
The STM32L562xx devices are an ultra-low-power microcontrollers family (STM32L5 Series) based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M33 32-bit RISC core. They operate at a frequency of up to 110 MHz.The Cortex®-M33 core features a single-precision floating-point unit (FPU), which supports all the Arm® single-precision data-processing instructions and all the data types. The Cortex®-M33 core also implements a full set of DSP (digital signal processing) instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances the application’s security.These devices embed high-speed memories (512 Kbytes of Flash memory and 256 Kbytes of SRAM), a flexible external memory controller (FSMC) for static memories (for devices with packages of 100 pins and more), an Octo-SPI Flash memories interface (available on all packages) and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, two AHB buses and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.The STM32L5 Series devices offer security foundation compliant with the trusted based security architecture (TBSA) requirements from Arm. They embed the necessary security features to implement a secure boot, secure data storage, secure firmware installation and secure firmware upgrade. Flexible life cycle is managed thanks to multiple levels of readout protection. Firmware hardware isolation is supported thanks to securable peripherals, memories and I/Os, and also to the possibility to configure the peripherals and memories as “privilege”.The STM32L562xx devices embed several protection mechanisms for embedded Flash memory and SRAM: readout protection, write protection, secure and hidden protection areas.The STM32L562xx devices embed several peripherals reinforcing security:- One AES coprocessor- One public key accelerator (PKA)- One on-the-fly decryption engine for Octo-SPI external memories- One HASH hardware accelerator- One true random number generatorThe STM32L5 Series devices offer active tamper detection and protection against transient and environmental perturbation attacks thanks to several internal monitoring which generate secret data erase in case of attack. This helps to fit the PCI requirements for point of sales applications. These devices offer two fast 12-bit ADC (5 Msps), two comparators, two operational amplifiers, two DAC channels, an internal voltage reference buffer, a low-power RTC, two general-purpose 32-bit timer, two 16-bit PWM timers dedicated to motor control, seven general-purpose 16-bit timers, and two 16-bit low-power timers. The devices support four digital filters for external sigma delta modulators (DFSDM). In addition, up to 22 capacitive sensing channels are available.STM32L5 Series also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces such as:- Four I2Cs- Three SPIs- Three USARTs, two UARTs and one low-power UART- Two SAIs- One SDMMC- One FDCAN- USB device FS- USB Type-C / USB power delivery controllerThe STM32L562xx devices embed an AES, PKA and OTFDEC hardware accelerator.The devices operate in the -40 to +85 °C (+105 °C junction) and -40 to +125 °C (+130 °C junction) temperature ranges from a 1.71 to 3.6 V power supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving modes allows the design of low-power applications.Some independent power supplies are supported like an analog independent supply input for ADC, DAC, OPAMPs and comparators, a 3.3 V dedicated supply input for USB and up to 14 I/Os, which can be supplied independently down to 1.08 V. A VBAT input allows the backup of the RTC and the backup of the registers.The STM32L562xx devices offer seven packages from 48-pin to 144-pin.
