Description: 
The STM32F373xx family is based on the high-performance ARM® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 72 MHz, and embedding a floating point unit (FPU), a memory protection unit (MPU) and an Embedded Trace Macrocell™ (ETM). The family incorporates high-speed embedded memories (up to 256 Kbyte of Flash memory, up to 32 Kbytes of SRAM), and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses.The STM32F373xx devices offer one fast 12-bit ADC (1 Msps), three 16-bit Sigma delta ADCs, two comparators, two DACs (DAC1 with 2 channels and DAC2 with 1 channel), a low-power RTC, 9 general-purpose 16-bit timers, two general-purpose 32-bit timers, three basic timers.They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces: two I2Cs, three SPIs, all with muxed I2Ss, three USARTs, CAN and USB.The STM32F373xx family operates in the -40 to +85 °C and -40 to +105 °C temperature ranges from a 2.0 to 3.6 V power supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving mode allows the design of low-power applications.The STM32F373xx family offers devices in five packages ranging from 48 pins to 100 pins. The set of included peripherals changes with the device chosen.
