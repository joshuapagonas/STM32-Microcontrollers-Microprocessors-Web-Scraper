Description: 
The STM32F437xx and STM32F439xx devices are based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 180 MHz. The Cortex-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports all Arm® single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security.The STM32F437xx and STM32F439xx devices incorporate high-speed embedded memories (Flash memory up to 2 Mbyte, up to 256 Kbytes of SRAM), up to 4 Kbytes of backup SRAM, and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, two AHB buses and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.All devices offer three 12-bit ADCs, two DACs, a low-power RTC, twelve general-purpose 16-bit timers including two PWM timers for motor control, two general-purpose 32-bit timers, a true random number generator (RNG) and a cryptographic acceleration cell. They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces.
