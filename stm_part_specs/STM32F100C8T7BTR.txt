Description: 
The STM32F100x4, STM32F100x6, STM32F100x8 and STM32F100xB microcontrollers incorporate the high-performance ARM®Cortex®-M3 32-bit RISC core operating at a 24 MHz frequency, high-speed embedded memories (Flash memory up to 128 Kbytes and SRAM up to 8 Kbytes), and an extensive range of enhanced peripherals and I/Os connected to two APB buses. All devices offer standard communication interfaces (up to two I2Cs, two SPIs, one HDMI CEC, and up to three USARTs), one 12-bit ADC, two 12-bit DACs, up to six general-purpose 16-bit timers and an advanced-control PWM timer.The STM32F100xx low- and medium-density devices operate in the – 40 to + 85 °C and – 40 to + 105 °C temperature ranges, from a 2.0 to 3.6 V power supply.A comprehensive set of power-saving mode allows the design of low-power applications.These microcontrollers include devices in three different packages ranging from 48 pins to 100 pins. Depending on the device chosen, different sets of peripherals are included.These features make these microcontrollers suitable for a wide range of applications such as application control and user interfaces, medical and hand-held equipment, PC and gaming peripherals, GPS platforms, industrial applications, PLCs, inverters, printers, scanners, alarm systems, video intercoms, and HVACs.
