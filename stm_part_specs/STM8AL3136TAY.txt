Description: 
The medium-density STM8AL313x/4x/6x and STM8AL3L4x/6x devices are members of the STM8AL automotive ultra-low-power 8-bit family. The medium-density STM8AL3xxx family operates from 1.8 V to 3.6 V (down to 1.65 V at power down) and is available in the -40 to +85°C and -40 to +125°C temperature ranges.The medium-density STM8AL3xxx ultra-low-power family features the enhanced STM8 CPU core providing increased processing power (up to 16 MIPS at 16 MHz) while maintaining the advantages of a CISC architecture with improved code density, a 24-bit linear addressing space and an optimized architecture for low power operations.The family includes an integrated debug module with a hardware interface (SWIM) which allows non-intrusive In-Application debugging and ultrafast Flash programming.All medium-density STM8AL3xxx microcontrollers feature embedded data EEPROM and low power low-voltage single-supply program Flash memory.They incorporate an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals.The modular design of the peripheral set allows the same peripherals to be found in different ST microcontroller families including 32-bit families. This makes any transition to a different family very easy, and simplified even more by the use of a common set of development tools.Two different packages are proposed which include 32 and 48 pins. Depending on the device chosen, different sets of peripherals are included.All STM8AL3xxx ultra-low-power products are based on the same architecture with the same memory mapping and a coherent pinout.
