Description: 
The STM32F358xC family is based on the high-performance ARM®Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core with FPU operating at a frequency of up to 72 MHz, and embedding a floating point unit (FPU), a memory protection unit (MPU) and an embedded trace macrocell (ETM). The family incorporates high-speed embedded memories (up to 256 Kbytes of Flash memory, up to 48 Kbytes of SRAM) and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses.The devices offer up to four fast 12-bit ADCs (5 Msps), up to seven comparators, up to four operational amplifiers, up to two DAC channels, a low-power RTC, up to five general-purpose 16-bit timers, one general-purpose 32-bit timer, and two timers dedicated to motor control. They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces: up to two I2Cs, up to three SPIs (two SPIs are with multiplexed full-duplex I2Ss on STM32F358xC devices), three USARTs, up to two UARTs, and CAN. To achieve audio class accuracy, the I2S peripherals can be clocked via an external PLL.The STM32F358xC family operates in the -40 to +85 °C and -40 to +105 °C temperature ranges. A comprehensive set of power-saving mode allows the design of low-power applications.The STM32F358xC family offers devices in three packages ranging from 48 pins to 100 pins.The set of included peripherals changes with the device chosen.
