Description: 
The STM8AF6246, STM8AF6248, STM8AF6266 and STM8AF6268 automotive 8-bit microcontrollers offer from 16 to 32 Kbyte of Flash program memory and integrated true data EEPROM. They are referred to as medium density STM8A devices in STM8S series and STM8AF series 8-bit microcontrollers reference manual (RM0016).All devices of the STM8A product line provide the following benefits: reduced system cost, performance and robustness, short development cycles, and product longevity.The system cost is reduced thanks to an integrated true data EEPROM for up to 300 k write/erase cycles and a high system integration level with internal clock oscillators, watchdog, and brown-out reset.Device performance is ensured by a clock frequency of up to 16 MHz CPU and enhanced characteristics which include robust I/O, independent watchdogs (with a separate clock source), and a clock security system.Short development cycles are guaranteed due to application scalability across a common family product architecture with compatible pinout, memory map and modular peripherals. Full documentation is offered with a wide choice of development tools.Product longevity is ensured in the STM8A family thanks to their advanced core which is made in a state-of-the art technology for automotive applications with 3.3 V to 5 V operating supply.All STM8A and ST7 microcontrollers are supported by the same tools including STVD/STVP development environment, the STice emulator and a low-cost, third party in-circuit debugging tool.
