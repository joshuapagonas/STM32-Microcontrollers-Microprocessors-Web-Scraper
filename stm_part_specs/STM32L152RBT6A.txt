Description: 
The ultra-low-power STM32L151x6/8/B-A and STM32L152x6/8/B-A devices incorporate the connectivity power of the universal serial bus (USB) with the high-performance ARM® Cortex®-M3 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of 32 MHz (33.3 DMIPS), a memory protection unit (MPU), high-speed embedded memories (Flash memory up to 128 Kbytes and RAM up to 32 Kbytes) and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses.All the devices offer a 12-bit ADC, 2 DACs and 2 ultra-low-power comparators, six general-purpose 16-bit timers and two basic timers, which can be used as time bases.Moreover, the STM32L151x6/8/B-A and STM32L152x6/8/B-A devices contain standard and advanced communication interfaces: up to two I2Cs and SPIs, three USARTs and a USB. The STM32L151x6/8/B-A and STM32L152x6/8/B-A devices offer up to 20 capacitive sensing channels to simply add touch sensing functionality to any application.They also include a real-time clock with sub-second counting and a set of backup registers that remain powered in Standby mode.Finally, the integrated LCD controller (except STM32L151x6/8/B-A devices) has a built-in LCD voltage generator that allows to drive up to 8 multiplexed LCDs with contrast independent of the supply voltage.The ultra-low-power STM32L151x6/8/B-A and STM32L152x6/8/B-A devices operate from a 1.8 to 3.6 V power supply (down to 1.65 V at power down) with BOR and from a 1.65 to 3.6 V power supply without BOR option. They are available in the -40 to +85 °C and -40 to +105°C temperature ranges. A comprehensive set of power-saving modes allows the design of low-power applications.
