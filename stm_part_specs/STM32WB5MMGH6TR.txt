Description: 
STM32WB5MMG is an ultra-low-power and small form factor certified 2.4 GHz wireless module. It supports Bluetooth® Low Energy 5.4, Zigbee® 3.0, OpenThread, dynamic, and static concurrent modes, and 802.15.4 proprietary protocols. Based on the STMicroelectronics STM32WB55VGY wireless microcontroller, STM32WB5MMG provides best-in-class RF performance thanks to its high receiver sensitivity and output power signal. Its low-power features enable extended battery life, small coin-cell batteries, and energy harvesting.STM32WB5MMG revision Y is based on cut 2.1 of the STM32WB55VGY microcontroller. Revision X is based on cut 2.2.STM32WB5MMG requires no RF expertise and is the best way to speed up any development and reduce associated costs. The module is completely protocol stack royalty-free.
