Description: 
The STM32G0B1xB/xC/xE mainstream microcontrollers are based on high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M0+ 32-bit RISC core operating at up to 64 MHz frequency. Offering a high level of integration, they are suitable for a wide range of applications in consumer, industrial and appliance domains and ready for the Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.The devices incorporate a memory protection unit (MPU), high-speed embedded memories (144 Kbytes of SRAM and up to 512 Kbytes of flash program memory with read protection, write protection, proprietary code protection, and securable area), DMA, an extensive range of system functions, enhanced I/Os, and peripherals. The devices offer standard communication interfaces (three I2Cs, three SPIs / two I2S, one HDMI CEC, one full-speed USB, two FD CANs, and six USARTs), one 12-bit ADC (2.5 MSps) with up to 19 channels, one 12-bit DAC with two channels, three fast comparators, an internal voltage reference buffer, a low-power RTC, an advanced control PWM timer running at up to double the CPU frequency, six general-purpose 16-bit timers with one running at up to double the CPU frequency, a 32-bit general-purpose timer, two basic timers, two low-power 16-bit timers, two watchdog timers, and a SysTick timer. The devices provide a fully integrated USB Type-C Power Delivery controller.The devices operate within ambient temperatures from -40 to 125°C and with supply voltages from 1.7 V to 3.6 V. Optimized dynamic consumption combined with a comprehensive set of power-saving modes, low-power timers and low-power UART, allows the design of low-power applications.VBAT direct battery input allows keeping RTC and backup registers powered.The devices come in packages with 32 to 100 pins. Some packages with low pin count are available in two pinouts (standard and alternative indicated by “N” suffix). Products marked by N suffix are offering VDDIO2 supply and additional UCPD port versus the standard pinout, therefore those are better choice for UCPD/USB applications.
