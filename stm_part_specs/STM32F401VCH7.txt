Description: 
The STM32F401xB/STM32F401xC devices are based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex® -M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 84 MHz. The Cortex®-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports all Arm single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security.The STM32F401xB/STM32F401xC incorporate high-speed embedded memories (up to 256 Kbytes of Flash memory, up to 64 Kbytes of SRAM), and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, two AHB buses and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.All devices offer one 12-bit ADC, a low-power RTC, six general-purpose 16-bit timers including one PWM timer for motor control, two general-purpose 32-bit timers. They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces.The STM32F401xB/STM32F401xC operate in the - 40 to + 125 °C temperature range from a 1.7 (PDR OFF) to 3.6 V power supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving mode allows the design of low-power applications.These features make the STM32F401xB/STM32F401xC microcontrollers suitable for a wide range of applications.
