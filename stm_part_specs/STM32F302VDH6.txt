Description: 
The STM32F302xD/E family is based on the high-performance ARM®Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core with FPU operating at a frequency of 72 MHz, and embedding a floating point unit (FPU), a memory protection unit (MPU) and an embedded trace macrocell (ETM). The family incorporates high-speed embedded memories (512-Kbyte Flash memory, 64-Kbyte SRAM), a flexible memory controller (FSMC) for static memories (SRAM, PSRAM, NOR and NAND), and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to an AHB and two APB buses.The devices offer two fast 12-bit ADCs (5 Msps), four comparators, two operational amplifiers, one DAC channel, a low-power RTC, up to two general-purpose 16-bit timers, one general-purpose 32-bit timer, and one timer dedicated to motor control. They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces: up to three I2Cs, up to four SPIs (two SPIs are with multiplexed full-duplex I2Ss), three USARTs, up to two UARTs, CAN and USB. To achieve audio class accuracy, the I2S peripherals can be clocked via an external PLL.The STM32F302xD/E family operates in the -40 to +85°C and -40 to +105°C temperature ranges from a 2.0 to 3.6 V power supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving mode allows the design of low-power applications.The STM32F302xD/E family offers devices in different packages ranging from 64 to 144 pins.Depending on the device chosen, different sets of peripherals are included.
