Description: 
The STM8S20xxx performance line 8-bit microcontrollers offer from 32 to 128 Kbytes Flash program memory. They are referred to as high-density devices in the STM8S microcontroller family reference manual.All STM8S20xxx devices provide the following benefits: reduced system cost, performance robustness, short development cycles, and product longevity.The system cost is reduced thanks to an integrated true data EEPROM for up to 300 k write/erase cycles and a high system integration level with internal clock oscillators, watchdog, and brown-out reset.Device performance is ensured by 20 MIPS at 24 MHz CPU clock frequency and enhanced characteristics which include robust I/O, independent watchdogs (with a separate clock source), and a clock security system.Short development cycles are guaranteed due to application scalability across a common family product architecture with compatible pinout, memory map and modular peripherals. Full documentation is offered with a wide choice of development tools.Product longevity is ensured in the STM8S family thanks to their advanced core which is made in a state-of-the art technology for applications with 2.95 V to 5.5 V operating supply.
