Description: 
The STM8AF6213, STM8AF6213A, STM8AF6223, STM8AF6223A and STM8AF6226 automotive 8-bit microcontrollers offer 4 to 8 Kbytes of Flash program memory, plus integrated true data EEPROM. The STM8S series and STM8AF series 8-bit microcontrollers reference manual (RM0016) refers to devices in this family as low-density. They provide the following benefits: performance, robustness and reduced system cost.Device performance and robustness are ensured by advanced core and peripherals made in a state-of-the-art technology, a 16 MHz clock frequency, robust I/Os, independent watchdogs with separate clock source, and a clock security system.The system cost is reduced thanks to an integrated true data EEPROM for up to 300 k write/erase cycles and a high system integration level with internal clock oscillators, watchdog, and brown-out reset.Full documentation is offered as well as a wide choice of development tools.
