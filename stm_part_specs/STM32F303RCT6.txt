Description: 
The STM32F303xB/STM32F303xC family is based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core with FPU operating at a frequency of up to 72 MHz, and embedding a floating point unit (FPU), a memory protection unit (MPU) and an embedded trace macrocell (ETM). The family incorporates high-speed embedded memories (up to 256 Kbytes of Flash memory, up to 40 Kbytes of SRAM) and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses.The devices offer up to four fast 12-bit ADCs (5 Msps), seven comparators, four operational amplifiers, up to two DAC channels, a low-power RTC, up to five general-purpose 16-bit timers, one general-purpose 32-bit timer, and two timers dedicated to motor control. They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces: up to two I2Cs, up to three SPIs (two SPIs are with multiplexed full-duplex I2Ss), three USARTs, up to two UARTs, CAN and USB. To achieve audio class accuracy, the I2S peripherals can be clocked via an external PLL.The STM32F303xB/STM32F303xC family operates in the -40 to +85 °C and -40 to +105 °C temperature ranges from a 2.0 to 3.6 V power supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving mode allows the design of low-power applications.The STM32F303xB/STM32F303xC family offers devices in four packages ranging from 48 pins to 100 pins.The set of included peripherals changes with the device chosen.
