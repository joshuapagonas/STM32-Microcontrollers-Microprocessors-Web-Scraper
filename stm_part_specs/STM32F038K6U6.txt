Description: 
The STM32F038x6 microcontrollers incorporate the high-performance ARM®Cortex®-M0 32-bit RISC core operating at up to 48 MHz frequency, high-speed embedded memories (32 Kbytes of Flash memory and 4 Kbytes of SRAM), and an extensive range of enhanced peripherals and I/Os. All devices offer standard communication interfaces (one I2C, one SPI/ I2S and one USART), one 12-bit ADC, five 16-bit timers, one 32-bit timer and an advanced-control PWM timer.The STM32F038x6 microcontrollers operate in the -40 to +85 °C and -40 to +105 °C temperature ranges at a 1.8 V ± 8% power supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving modes allows the design of low-power applications.The STM32F038x6 microcontrollers include devices in five different packages ranging from 20 pins to 48 pins with a die form also available upon request. Depending on the device chosen, different sets of peripherals are included.These features make the STM32F038x6 microcontrollers suitable for a wide range of applications such as application control and user interfaces, hand-held equipment, A/V receivers and digital TV, PC peripherals, gaming and GPS platforms, industrial applications, PLCs, inverters, printers, scanners, alarm systems, video intercoms and HVACs.
