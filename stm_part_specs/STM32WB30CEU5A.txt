Description: 
The STM32WB50CG and STM32WB30CE multiprotocol wireless and ultra-low-power device embeds a powerful and ultra-low-power radio compliant with the Bluetooth® Low Energy SIG specification 5.4 or with IEEE 802.15.4-2011. It contains a dedicated Arm® Cortex®-M0+ for performing all the real-time low layer operation.The devices are designed to be extremely low-power and are based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 64 MHz. This core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision that supports all Arm®single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) that enhances application security.Enhanced inter-processor communication is provided by the IPCC with six bidirectional channels. The HSEM provides hardware semaphores used to share common resources between the two processors.The devices embed high-speed memories (1 Mbyte of flash memory for STM32WB50xx, 512 Kbytes for STM32WB30xx, 128 Kbytes of SRAM for STM32WB50xx, 96 Kbytes for STM32WB30xx) and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals.Direct data transfer between memory and peripherals and from memory to memory is supported by seven DMA channels with a full flexible channel mapping by the DMAMUX peripheral.The devices feature several mechanisms for embedded flash memory and SRAM: readout protection, write protection and proprietary code readout protection. Portions of the memory can be secured for Cortex® -M0+ exclusive access.The AES encryption engine, PKA, and RNG enable lower layer MAC and upper layer cryptography.The devices offer a fast 16-bit ADC.These devices embed a low-power RTC, one advanced 16-bit timer, one general-purpose32-bit timer, two general-purpose 16-bit timers, and two 16-bit low-power timers.The STM32WB50CG and STM32WB30CE also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces, namely one USART (ISO 7816, IrDA, Modbus, and Smartcard mode), one I2C (SMBus/PMBus), one SPI up to 32 MHz.The STM32WB50CG and STM32WB30CE operate in the -10 to +85 °C (+105 °C junction) temperature range from a 2.0 to 3.6 V power supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving modes enables the design of low-power applications.The devices include independent power supplies for analog input for ADC.A VBAT dedicated supply allows the device to back up the LSE 32.768 kHz oscillator, the RTC and the backup registers, thus enabling the STM32WB50CG and STM32WB30CE to supply these functions even if the main VDD is not present through a CR2032-like battery, a Supercap or a small rechargeable battery.The STM32WB50CG and STM32WB30CE are available in a 48-pin UFQFPN package.
