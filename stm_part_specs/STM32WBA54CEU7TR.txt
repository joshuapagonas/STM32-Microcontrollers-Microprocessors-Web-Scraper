Description: 
The STM32WBA5xxx multiprotocol wireless and ultra-low power devices embed a powerful and ultra-low power radio compliant with the Bluetooth® SIG Low Energy specification 5.4. They operate at a frequency of up to 100 MHz.The devices integrate a 2.4 GHz RADIO supporting Bluetooth Low Energy, and make possible to use proprietary protocols.The STM32WBA5xxx are based on a high-performance Arm Cortex-M33 32-bit RISC core, featuring a single-precision floating-point unit (FPU), supporting all the Arm single-precision data-processing instructions and all the data types. This core also implements a full set of DSP (digital signal processing) instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) that enhances the application security.The devices embed high-speed memories (up to 1 Mbyte of flash memory and up to 128 Kbytes of SRAM), an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to AHB and APB buses on the 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.The devices offer security foundation compliant with the TBSA (trusted-based security architecture) requirements from Arm. It embeds the necessary security features to implement a secure boot, secure data storage, and secure firmware update. Besides these capabilities, the devices incorporate a secure firmware installation feature that allows the customer to secure the provisioning of the code during its production. A flexible life cycle is managed thanks to multiple levels readout protection and debug unlock with password.Firmware hardware isolation is supported thanks to securable peripherals, memories and I/Os, and privilege configuration of peripherals and memories.Several protection mechanisms are available for embedded flash memory and SRAM: readout protection, write protection, secure, and hide protection areas.The devices embed several peripherals reinforcing security: a fast AES coprocessor, a secure AES coprocessor with DPA resistance and hardware unique key that can be shared by hardware with fast AES, a PKA (public key accelerator) with DPA resistance, a HASH hardware accelerator, and a true random number generator.Active tamper detection and protection against transient perturbation attacks, is achieved thanks to several internal monitoring generating secret data erase in case of attack. This helps to fit the PCI requirements for point of sales applications.Hardware semaphores enable the synchronization between software processes.The devices offer one 12-bit ADC (2.5 Msps), two comparators, a low-power RTC, one 32-bit general-purpose timer, one 16-bit PWM timer for motor control, three 16-bit general-purpose timers, and two 16-bit low-power timers. They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces, namely two I2Cs, two SPIs, one SAI, two USARTs, and one low-power UART. The feature set is product-dependent.The STM32WBA5xxx operate in the -40 °C to 105 °C (120 °C junction) temperature range from a 1.71 to 3.6 V power supply.The design of low-power applications is enabled by a comprehensive set of power-saving modes.Many peripherals (including radio, communication, analog, and timer peripherals) can be functional and autonomous in Stop mode with direct memory access thanks to BAM (background autonomous mode) support.Some independent power supplies are supported, like an analog independent supply input for ADC and comparators, and radio dedicated supply inputs for the 2.4 GHz RADIO.The STM32WBA5xxx devices offer three packages, up to 59 pins, with or without SMPS.
