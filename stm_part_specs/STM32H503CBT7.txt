Description: 
The STM32H503xx devices are a high-performance microcontrollers family (STM32H5 series) based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M33 32-bit RISC core. They operate at a frequency of up to 250 MHz.The Cortex®-M33 core features a single-precision floating-point unit (FPU) that supports all the Arm® single-precision data-processing instructions and all the data types.The Cortex®-M33 core also implements a full set of DSP (digital signal processing) instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) that enhances the application security.The devices embed high-speed memories (128 Kbytes of dual bank flash memory and 32 Kbytes of SRAM), and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to three APB buses, three AHB buses, and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.The devices feature several protection mechanisms for embedded flash memory and SRAM: secure life cycle management, write protection and hide protection areas.The devices embed several peripherals reinforcing security: a HASH hardware accelerator and a true random number generator.The devices offer active tamper detection and protection against transient and environmental perturbation attacks. It is done thanks to several internal monitoring that generate a secret data erase in case of an attack.The devices offer a fast 12-bit ADC, two DAC channels, an OPAMP, a comparator, a low-power RTC, one 32-bit general-purpose timer, one 16-bit PWM timer dedicated to motor control, one 16-bit general-purpose timer, two 16-bit basic timers and two 16-bit low-power timers.The devices also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces such as: two I²Cs, two I3Cs shared with I²C, three SPIs with muxed full-duplex I2S, three USARTs and one low-power UART, one FDCAN, and one USB full-speed.The devices operate in the - 40 to + 85 °C/105 °C, and up to 125 °C at low dissipation (+130 °C junction) temperature ranges from a 1.71 to 3.6 V power supply.A comprehensive set of power-saving modes allows the design of low-power applications.Some independent power supplies are supported like an analog independent supply input for ADC, DACs, COMP and OPAMP, and a dedicated supply input for some GPIOs. A VBAT input is available for connecting a backup battery. This battery preserves the RTC functionality and backup 32x 32-bit registers and 2-Kbyte SRAM.The devices offer five packages from 25-pin to 64-pin.
