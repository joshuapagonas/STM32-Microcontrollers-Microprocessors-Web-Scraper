Description: 
The STM32F102xx medium-density USB access line incorporates the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M3 32-bit RISC core operating at a 48 MHz frequency, high-speed embedded memories (Flash memory of 16 or 32 Kbytes and SRAM of 4 or 6 Kbytes), and an extensive range of enhanced peripherals and I/Os connected to two APB buses. All devices offer standard communication interfaces (one I2C, one SPI, one USB and two USARTs), one 12-bit ADC and two general-purpose 16-bit timers.The STM32F102xx family operates in the –40 to +85 °C temperature range, from a 2.0 to 3.6 V power supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving mode allows the design of low-power applications.The STM32F102xx medium-density USB access line is delivered in the LQFP48 7 × 7 mm and LQFP64 10 × 10 mm packages.The STM32F102xx medium-density USB access line microcontrollers are suitable for a wide range of applications.
