Description: 
The STM32L496xx devices are ultra-low-power microcontrollers based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 80 MHz. The Cortex-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision that supports all Arm® single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security.The STM32L496xx devices embed high-speed memories (up to 1 Mbyte of flash memory, 320 Kbyte of SRAM), a flexible external memory controller (FSMC) for static memories (for devices with packages of 100 pins and more), a Quad SPI flash memories interface (available on all packages) and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, two AHB buses and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.The STM32L496xx devices embed several protection mechanisms for embedded flash memory and SRAM: readout protection, write protection, proprietary code readout protection and Firewall.The devices offer up to three fast 12-bit ADCs (5 Msps), two comparators, two operational amplifiers, two DAC channels, an internal voltage reference buffer, a low-power RTC, two general-purpose 32-bit timer, two 16-bit PWM timers dedicated to motor control, seven general-purpose 16-bit timers, and two 16-bit low-power timers. The devices support four digital filters for external sigma delta modulators (DFSDM).In addition, up to 24 capacitive sensing channels are available. The devices also embed an integrated LCD driver 8x40 or 4x44, with internal step-up converter.They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces, namely four I2Cs, three SPIs, three USARTs, two UARTs and one Low-Power UART, two SAIs, one SDMMC, two CANs, one USB OTG full-speed, one SWPMI (single wire protocol master interface), a camera interface and a DMA2D controller.The STM32L496xx devices embed HASH hardware accelerators.The STM32L496xx operates in the -40 to +85 °C (+105 °C junction), -40 to +125 °C (+130 °C junction) temperature ranges from a 1.71 to 3.6 V VDD power supply when using internal LDO regulator and a 1.05 to 1.32V VDD12 power supply when using external SMPS supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving modes makes possible the design of low-power applications.Some independent power supplies are supported: analog independent supply input for ADC, DAC, OPAMPs and comparators, 3.3 V dedicated supply input for USB and up to 14 I/Os can be supplied independently down to 1.08 V. A VBAT input makes it possible to backup the RTC and backup registers. Dedicated VDD12 power supplies can be used to bypass the internal LDO regulator when connected to an external SMPS.The STM32L496xx family offers seven packages from 64-pin to 169-pin packages.
