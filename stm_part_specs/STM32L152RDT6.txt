Description: 
The ultra-low-power STM32L151xD and STM32L152xD devices incorporate the connectivity power of the universal serial bus (USB) with the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M3 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of 32 MHz (33.3 DMIPS), a memory protection unit (MPU), high-speed embedded memories (Flash memory up to 384 Kbytes and RAM up to 48 Kbytes), a flexible static memory controller (FSMC) interface (for devices with packages of 100 pins and more) and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses.The STM32L151xD and STM32L152xD devices offer three operational amplifiers, one 12-bit ADC, two DACs, two ultra-low-power comparators, one general-purpose 32-bit timer, six general-purpose 16-bit timers and two basic timers, which can be used as time bases.Moreover, the STM32L151xD and STM32L152xD devices contain standard and advanced communication interfaces: up to two I2Cs, three SPIs, two I2S, one SDIO, three USARTs, two UARTs, and an USB. The STM32L151xD and STM32L152xD devices offer up to 34 capacitive sensing channels to simply add a touch sensing functionality to any application.They also include a real-time clock and a set of backup registers that remain powered in Standby mode.Finally, the integrated LCD controller (except STM32L151xD devices) has a built-in LCD voltage generator that allows to drive up to 8 multiplexed LCDs with the contrast independent of the supply voltage.The ultra-low-power STM32L151xD and STM32L152xD devices operate from a 1.8 to 3.6 V power supply (down to 1.65 V at power down) with BOR and from a 1.65 to 3.6 V power supply without BOR option. They are available in the -40 to +85 °C and -40 to +105 °C temperature ranges. A comprehensive set of power-saving modes allows the design of low-power applications.
