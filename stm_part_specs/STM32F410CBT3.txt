Description: 
The STM32F410x8/B devices are based on the high-performance ARM®Cortex® -M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 100 MHz. Their Cortex®-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports all ARM single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security.The STM32F410x8/B belong to the STM32 Dynamic Efficiency™ product line (with products combining power efficiency, performance and integration) while adding a new innovative feature called Batch Acquisition Mode (BAM) allowing to save even more power consumption during data batching.The STM32F410x8/B incorporate high-speed embedded memories (up to 128 Kbytes of Flash memory, 32 Kbytes of SRAM), and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, one AHB bus and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.All devices offer one 12-bit ADC, one 12-bit DAC, a low-power RTC, three general-purpose 16-bit timers, one PWM timer for motor control, one general-purpose 32-bit timers and one 16-bit low-power timer. They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces.
