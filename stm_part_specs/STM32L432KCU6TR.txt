Description: 
The STM32L432xx devices are the ultra-low-power microcontrollers based on the high-performance ARM® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 80 MHz. The Cortex-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports all ARM single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security.The STM32L432xx devices embed high-speed memories (Flash memory up to 256 Kbyte, 64 Kbyte of SRAM), a Quad SPI flash memories interface and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, two AHB buses and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.The STM32L432xx devices embed several protection mechanisms for embedded Flash memory and SRAM: readout protection, write protection, proprietary code readout protection and Firewall.The devices offer a fast 12-bit ADC (5 Msps), two comparators, one operational amplifier, two DAC channels, a low-power RTC, one general-purpose 32-bit timer, one 16-bit PWM timer dedicated to motor control, four general-purpose 16-bit timers, and two 16-bit low-power timers.In addition, up to 3 capacitive sensing channels are available.They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces.
