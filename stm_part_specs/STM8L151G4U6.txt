Description: 
The medium-density STM8L151x4/6 and STM8L152x4/6 devices are members of the STM8L ultra-low-power 8-bit family. The medium-density STM8L15x family operates from 1.8 V to 3.6 V (down to 1.65 V at power down) and is available in the -40 to +85 °C and -40 to +125 °C temperature ranges.The medium-density STM8L15x ultra-low-power family features the enhanced STM8 CPU core providing increased processing power (up to 16 MIPS at 16 MHz) while maintaining the advantages of a CISC architecture with improved code density, a 24-bit linear addressing space and an optimized architecture for low power operations.The family includes an integrated debug module with a hardware interface (SWIM) which allows non-intrusive In-Application debugging and ultra-fast Flash programming.All medium-density STM8L15x microcontrollers feature embedded data EEPROM and low-power, low-voltage, single-supply program Flash memory.They incorporate an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals.The modular design of the peripheral set allows the same peripherals to be found in different ST microcontroller families including 32-bit families. This makes any transition to a different family very easy, and simplified even more by the use of a common set of development tools.Six different packages are proposed from 28 to 48 pins. Depending on the device chosen, different sets of peripherals are included.All STM8L ultra-low-power products are based on the same architecture with the same memory mapping and a coherent pinout.
