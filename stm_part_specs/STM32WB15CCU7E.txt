Description: 
The STM32WB15CC multiprotocol wireless and ultra-low-power device embeds a powerful and ultra-low-power radio compliant with the Bluetooth® Low Energy SIG specification 5.4. It contains a dedicated Arm® Cortex®-M0+ for performing all the real-time low layer operation.The device is designed to be extremely low-power and is based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 64 MHz. This core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision that supports all Arm®single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) that enhances application security.Enhanced inter-processor communication is provided by the IPCC with six bidirectional channels. The HSEM provides hardware semaphores used to share common resources between the two processors.The device embeds high-speed memories (320 Kbytes of flash memory, 48 Kbytes of SRAM) and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals.Direct data transfer between memory and peripherals and from memory to memory is supported by seven DMA channels with a full flexible channel mapping by the DMAMUX peripheral.The device feature several mechanisms for embedded flash memory and SRAM: readout protection, write protection and proprietary code readout protection. Portions of the memory can be secured for Cortex® -M0+ exclusive access.The AES encryption engine, PKA, and RNG enable upper layer cryptography.The device offers a fast 12-bit ADC and one ultra-low-power comparator.The device embeds a low-power RTC, one advanced 16-bit timer, one general-purpose32-bit timer, and two 16-bit low-power timers.In addition, up to eight capacitive sensing channels are available.The STM32WB15CC also features standard and advanced communication interfaces, namely one USART (ISO 7816, IrDA, Modbus, and Smartcard mode), one low- power UART (LPUART), one I2C (SMBus/PMBus), one SPI up to 32 MHz.The STM32WB15CC operates in the -40 to +85 °C (+105 °C junction) and -40 to +105 °C (+125 °C junction) temperature ranges from a 1.71 to 3.6 V power supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving modes enables the design of low-power applications.The STM32WB15CC integrates a high efficiency SMPS step-down converter with automatic bypass mode capability when the VDD falls below VBORx (x = 1, 2, 3, 4) voltage level (default is 2.0 V). It includes independent power supplies for analog input for ADC and comparator.A VBAT dedicated supply allows the device to back up the LSE 32.768 kHz oscillator, the RTC and the backup registers, thus enabling the STM32WB15CC to supply these functions even if the main VDD is not present through a CR2032-like battery, a Supercap or a small rechargeable battery.The STM32WB15CC offers two packages, 48 or 49 pins.
