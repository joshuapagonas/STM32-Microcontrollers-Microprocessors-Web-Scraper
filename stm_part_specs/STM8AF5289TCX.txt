Description: 
The STM8AF526x/8x/Ax and STM8AF6269/8x/Ax automotive 8-bit microcontrollers described in this datasheet offer from 32 Kbyte to 128 Kbyte of non volatile memory and integrated true data EEPROM. They are referred to as high density STM8A devices in STM8S series and STM8AF series 8-bit microcontrollers reference manual (RM0016).The STM8AF52 series features a CAN interface.All devices of the STM8A product line provide the following benefits: reduced system cost, performance and robustness, short development cycles, and product longevity.The system cost is reduced thanks to an integrated true data EEPROM for up to 300 k write/erase cycles and a high system integration level with internal clock oscillators, wtachdog, and brown-out reset.Device performance is ensured by 20 MIPS at 24 MHz CPU clock frequency and enhanced characteristics which include robust I/O, independent watchdogs (with a separate clock source), and a clock security system.Short development cycles are guaranteed due to application scalability across a common family product architecture with compatible pinout, memory map, and modular peripherals. Full documentation is offered with a wide choice of development tools.Product longevity is ensured in the STM8A family thanks to their advanced core which is made in a state-of-the art technology for automotive applications with 3.3 V to 5.5 V operating supply.All STM8A and ST7 microcontrollers are supported by the same tools including STVD/STVP development environment, the STice emulator and a low-cost, third party in-circuit debugging tool.
