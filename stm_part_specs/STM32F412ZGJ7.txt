Description: 
STM32F412xE/G devices are based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex® -M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 100 MHz. Their Cortex®-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports all Arm single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security.STM32F412xE/G devices belong to the STM32 Dynamic Efficiency™ product line (with products combining power efficiency, performance and integration) while adding a new innovative feature called Batch Acquisition Mode (BAM) allowing even more power consumption saving during data batching.STM32F412xE/G devices incorporate high-speed embedded memories (up to 1 Mbyte of flash memory, 256 Kbytes of SRAM), and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, three AHB buses and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.All devices offer one 12-bit ADC, a low-power RTC, twelve general-purpose 16-bit timers, two PWM timers for motor control and two general-purpose 32-bit timers.They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces:- Up to four I2Cs, including one I2C supporting Fast-Mode Plus- Five SPIs- Five I2Ss of which two are full duplex. To achieve audio class accuracy, the I2S peripherals can be clocked via a dedicated internal audio PLL, or via an external clock to allow synchronization.- Four USARTs- An SDIO/MMC interface- A USB 2.0 OTG full-speed interface- Two CANs.In addition, STM32F412xE/G devices embed advanced peripherals:- A flexible static memory controller interface (FSMC)- A Quad-SPI memory interface- A digital filter for sigma modulator (DFSDM), two filters, up to four inputs, and support of microphone MEMs.STM32F412xE/G devices are offered in 7 packages ranging from 48 to 144 pins. The set of available peripherals depends on the selected package.The STM32F412xE/G operates in the -40 to +125 °C temperature range from a 1.7 (PDR OFF) to 3.6 V power supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving modes allows the design of low-power applications.
