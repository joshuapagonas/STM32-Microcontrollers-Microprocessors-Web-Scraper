Description: 
The STM32MP151A/D devices are based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-A7 32-bit RISC core operating at up to 800 MHz. The Cortex-A7 processor includes a 32-Kbyte L1 instruction cache, a 32-Kbyte L1 data cache and a 256-Kbyte level2 cache. The Cortex-A7 processor is a very energy-efficient application processor designed to provide rich performance in high-end wearables, and other low-power embedded and consumer applications. It provides up to 20% more single thread performance than the Cortex-A5 and provides similar performance than the Cortex-A9.The Cortex-A7 incorporates all features of the high-performance Cortex-A15 and Cortex-A17 processors, including virtualization support in hardware, NEON™, and 128-bit AMBA®4 AXI bus interface.The STM32MP151A/D devices also embed a Cortex® -M4 32-bit RISC core operating at up to 209 MHz frequency. Cortex-M4 core features a floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports Arm® single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. The Cortex® -M4 supports a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security.The STM32MP151A/D devices provide an external SDRAM interface supporting external memories up to 8-Gbit density (1 Gbyte), 16 or 32-bit LPDDR2/LPDDR3 or DDR3/DDR3L up to 533 MHz.The STM32MP151A/D devices incorporate high-speed embedded memories with 708 Kbytes of Internal SRAM (including 256 Kbytes of AXI SYSRAM, 3 banks of 128 Kbytes each of AHB SRAM, 64 Kbytes of AHB SRAM in backup domain and 4 Kbytes of SRAM in backup domain), as well as an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to APB buses, AHB buses, a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix and a 64-bit multi layer AXI interconnect supporting internal and external memories access.All the devices offer two ADCs, two DACs, a low-power RTC, 12 general-purpose 16-bit timers, two PWM timers for motor control, five low-power timers, a true random number generator (RNG). The devices support six digital filters for external sigma delta modulators (DFSDM). They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces.
