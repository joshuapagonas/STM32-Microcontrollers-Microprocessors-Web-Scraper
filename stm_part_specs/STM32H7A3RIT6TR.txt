Description: 
STM32H7A3xI/G devices are based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M7 32-bit RISC core operating at up to 280 MHz. The Cortex® -M7 core features a floating point unit (FPU) which supports Arm® double-precision (IEEE 754 compliant) and single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. STM32H7A3xI/G devices support a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) to enhance application security.STM32H7A3xI/G devices incorporate high-speed embedded memories with a dual-bank Flash memory up to 2 Mbytes, around 1.4 Mbyte of RAM (including 192 Kbytes of TCM RAM, 1.18 Mbytes of user SRAM and 4 Kbytes of backup SRAM), as well as an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to four APB buses, three AHB buses, a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix and a multi layer AXI interconnect supporting internal and external memory access.All the devices offer two ADCs, two DACs (one dual and one single DAC), two ultra-low power comparators, a low-power RTC, 12 general-purpose 16-bit timers, two PWM timers for motor control, three low-power timers, a true random number generator (RNG). The devices support nine digital filters for external sigma delta modulators (DFSDM). They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces.
