Description: 
The STM32WB1MMC is an ultra-low power, small form factor, certified 2.4 GHz wireless module, supporting Bluetooth® Low Energy 5.4. Based on the STM32WB15CCY wireless microcontroller, it provides best-in-class RF performance thanks to its good receiver sensitivity and a high output power signal. Its low power features enable extended battery life time, small coin-cell batteries, or energy harvesting.The STM32WB1MMC requires no RF expertise, and is the best way to speed up the application development and to reduce the associated costs. The module is completely protocol stack royalty-free.
