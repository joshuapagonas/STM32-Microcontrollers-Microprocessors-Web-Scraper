Description: 
The STM32WB09xE is an ultra-low power programmable Bluetooth® Low Energy wireless SoC solution. It embeds STMicroelectronics’ state-of-art 2.4 GHz RF radio peripherals, optimized for ultra-low-power consumption and excellent radio performance, for unparalleled battery lifetime.It is compliant with Bluetooth® Low Energy SIG core specification version 5.4 addressing point-to-point connectivity and Bluetooth® Mesh networking and allows large-scale device networks to be established in a reliable way. The STM32WB09xE is also suitable for 2.4 GHz proprietary radio wireless communication to address ultra-low latency applications.The STM32WB09xE embeds an Arm® Cortex®-M0+ microprocessor that can operate up to 64 MHz and also the radio core coprocessor (DMA based) for Bluetooth® Low Energy timing critical operations.In addition, the STM32WB09xE provides enhanced security hardware support by dedicated hardware functions: true random number generator (TRNG) supporting NIST special publication 800-90B, security c0-processor for 128-bit AES encryption, CRC calculation unit, 64-bit unique ID, flash memory read and write protection, and a public key accelerator (PKA).The PKA supports: modular arithmetic including exponentiation with maximum modulo size of 3136 bits, elliptic curves over prime field scalar multiplication, ECDSA signature, ECDSA verification with maximum modulo size of 521 bits CRC calculation unit, security level allowing constant time operations.The STM32WB09xE can be configured to support standalone or network processor applications. In the first configuration, the STM32WB09xE operates as a single device running the application code and the Bluetooth® Low Energy stack.The STM32WB09xE embeds the following high-speed memory types: 512-Kbyte flash memory, 64-Kbyte RAM, 1-Kbyte one-time-programmable (OTP) memory area, and 7-Kbyte ROM (ST reserved area).Direct data transfer between memory and peripherals and from memory-to-memory is supported by eight DMA channels with a full flexible channel mapping by the DMAMUX peripheral.The STM32WB09xE embeds a 12-bit ADC, allowing measurements of up to eight external sources and up to three internal sources, including battery monitoring and a temperature sensor.The STM32WB09xE has a low-power RTC and one advanced 16-bit timer.The STM32WB09xE features standard and advanced communication interfaces: 1x SPI-I2, LPUART, 1x USART supporting ISO 7816 (SmartCard mode), IrDA and Modbus mode, 2x I2C supporting SMBus/PMBus.The STM32WB09xE operates in the -40 to +105 °C (+125 °C junction) temperature range from a 1.7 V to 3.6 V power supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving modes enables the design of low-power applications.The STM32WB09xE integrates a high efficiency SMPS step-down converter and an integrated PDR circuitry with a fixed threshold that generates a device reset when the VDD drops under 1.65 V.The STM32WB09xE is available in two package types: VFQFPN32 and WLCSP36. Both versions support up to 20 I/Os.
