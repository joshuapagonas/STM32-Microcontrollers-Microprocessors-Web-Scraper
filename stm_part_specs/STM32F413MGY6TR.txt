Description: 
The STM32F413xG/H devices are based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 100 MHz. Their Cortex®-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports all Arm single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security.The STM32F413xG/H devices belong to the STM32F4 access product lines (with products combining power efficiency, performance and integration) while adding a new innovative feature called Batch Acquisition Mode (BAM) allowing to save even more power consumption during data batching.The STM32F413xG/H devices incorporate high-speed embedded memories (up to 1.5 Mbytes of Flash memory, 320 Kbytes of SRAM), and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, three AHB buses and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.All devices offer a 12-bit ADC, two 12-bit DACs, a low-power RTC, twelve general-purpose 16-bit timers including two PWM timer for motor control, two general-purpose 32-bit timers and a low power timer.They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces.
