Description: 
STM32L4Q5xx designates a family of ultra-low-power microcontroller devices (part of STM32L4+ Series) based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core. They operate at a frequency of up to 120 MHz.The Cortex-M4 core features a single-precision floating-point unit (FPU), which supports all the Arm® single-precision data-processing instructions and all the data types. The Cortex-M4 core also implements a full set of DSP (digital signal processing) instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) that enhances the application’s security.These devices embed high-speed memories (1 Mbyte of Flash memory and 320 Kbytes of SRAM), a flexible external memory controller (FSMC) for static memories (for devices with packages of 100 pins and more), two OCTOSPI Flash memory interfaces (for devices with packages of 100 pins or more) and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, two AHB buses and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.These devices embed several protection mechanisms for embedded Flash memory and SRAM: readout protection, write protection, proprietary code readout protection and a firewall.These devices offer two fast 12-bit ADCs (5 Msps), two comparators, two operational amplifiers, two DAC channels, an internal voltage reference buffer, a low-power RTC, two general-purpose 32-bit timers, two 16-bit PWM timers dedicated to motor control, seven general-purpose 16-bit timers, and two 16-bit low-power timers. The devices support two digital filters for external sigma delta modulators (DFSDMs). In addition, up to 24 capacitive sensing channels are available.They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces such as:- Four I2Cs- Three SPIs- Three USARTs, two UARTs and one low-power UART- Two SAIs- Two SDMMCs- One CAN- One USB OTG full-speed- Camera interface- Synchronous parallel data interface (PSSI)STM32L4Q5xx devices embed an AES and a PKA hardware accelerator.The devices operate in the -40 to +85 °C (+105 °C junction) and -40 to +125 °C (+130 °C junction) temperature ranges from a 1.71 to 3.6 V power supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving modes allows the design of low-power applications.Some independent power supplies are supported such as an analog independent supply input for ADC, DAC, OPAMPs and comparators, a 3.3 V dedicated supply input for USB and up to 14 I/Os, which can be supplied independently down to 1.08 V. A VBAT input allows backup of the RTC and the registers. Dedicated VDD12 power supplies can be used to bypass the internal LDO regulator when connected to an external SMPS.The STM32L4Q5xx family offers eight packages from 48-pin to 169-pin.
