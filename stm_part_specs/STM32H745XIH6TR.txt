Description: 
STM32H745xI/G devices are based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M7 and Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC cores. The Cortex®-M7 core operates at up to 480 MHz and the Cortex®-M4 core at up to 240 MHz. Both cores feature a floating point unit (FPU) which supports Arm® single- and double-precision (Cortex®-M7 core) operations and conversions (IEEE 754 compliant), including a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) to enhance application security.STM32H745xI/G devices incorporate high-speed embedded memories with a dual-bank flash memory of up to 2 Mbytes, up to 1 Mbyte of RAM (including 192 Kbytes of TCM RAM, up to 864 Kbytes of user SRAM and 4 Kbytes of backup SRAM), as well as an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to APB buses, AHB buses, 2x32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix and a multi layer AXI interconnect supporting internal and external memory access.All the devices offer three ADCs, two DACs, two ultra-low power comparators, a low-power RTC, a high-resolution timer, 12 general-purpose 16-bit timers, two PWM timers for motor control, five low-power timers, a true random number generator (RNG). The devices support four digital filters for external sigma-delta modulators (DFSDM). They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces.
