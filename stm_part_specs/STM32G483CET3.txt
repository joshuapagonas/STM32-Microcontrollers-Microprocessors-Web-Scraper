Description: 
The STM32G483xE devices are based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core. They operate at a frequency of up to 170 MHz.The Cortex-M4 core features a single-precision floating-point unit (FPU), which supports all the Arm single-precision data-processing instructions and all the data types. It also implements a full set of DSP (digital signal processing) instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances the application’s security.These devices embed high-speed memories (up to 512 Kbytes of Flash memory, and 128 Kbytes of SRAM), a flexible external memory controller (FSMC) for static memories (for devices with packages of 100 pins and more), a Quad-SPI Flash memory interface, and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, two AHB buses and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.The devices also embed several protection mechanisms for embedded Flash memory and SRAM: readout protection, write protection, securable memory area and proprietary code readout protection.The devices embed peripherals allowing mathematical/arithmetic function acceleration (CORDIC for trigonometric functions and FMAC unit for filter functions).They offer five fast 12-bit ADCs (4 Msps), seven comparators, six operational amplifiers, seven DAC channels (3 external and 4 internal), an internal voltage reference buffer, a low-power RTC, two general-purpose 32-bit timers, three 16-bit PWM timers dedicated to motor control, seven general-purpose 16-bit timers, and one 16-bit low-power timer.They also feature standard and advanced communication interfaces such as:- Four I2Cs- Four SPIs multiplexed with two half duplex I2Ss- Three USARTs, two UARTs and one low-power UART.- Three FDCANs- One SAI- USB device- UCPDThe STM32G483xE devices embed an AES.The devices operate in the -40 to +85 °C (+105 °C junction) and -40 to +125 °C (+130 °C junction) temperature ranges from a 1.71 to 3.6 V power supply. A comprehensive set of power-saving modes allows the design of low-power applications.Some independent power supplies are supported including an analog independent supply input for ADC, DAC, OPAMPs and comparators. A VBAT input allows backup of the RTC and the registers.The STM32G483xE family offers 8 packages from 48-pin to 128-pin.
